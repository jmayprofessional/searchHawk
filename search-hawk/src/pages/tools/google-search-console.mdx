    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-purple-400 mb-2">Using GSC to improve your local business</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-400">
      Once you start getting data, focus on the pages and keywords that bring the most traffic. Identify opportunities where you appear on page 2 or 3 and optimize those pages to move up. Check coverage issues weekly and fix them promptly. For local businesses, pay attention to location-based queries and click trends to understand which services or locations drive the most interest.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-400">
      Monitor your site every 1–2 weeks to ensure your pages stay visible and fix new errors immediately. Over time, this will help your website rank higher, attract more local visitors, and generate more leads.
