# Website Alignment Overview

**Purpose:** Your website should reinforce your Google Business Profile. Google looks for:

- NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency  
- Service & location matching  
- Structured content (H1, H2, service pages)  
- Schema markup (LocalBusiness)

Following this alignment ensures your GBP and website “signal” the same thing to Google, boosting local rankings.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Confirm website domain matches your GBP
- [ ] Check NAP consistency across site and GBP
- [ ] Identify main services to mirror on the website
- [ ] Plan location pages if serving multiple areas
- [ ] Review website for schema implementation opportunities

**Notes:**  
*(Optional: write down main services and cities for website alignment)*
